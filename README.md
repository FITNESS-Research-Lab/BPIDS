# Business Process Intrusion Detection System

## Description
This repository includes all the essential information for setting up and utilizing the Business Process Detection System. This tool offers a straightforward method for monitoring a business process, starting from the business process specification provided in XML format. This is achieved by constructing finite state machines for various tasks described in the XML file, enabling the Finite State Machine Analyzer to observe and assess states and transitions within the specified FSM.

The tool is designed to facilitate seamless communication with a Kafka broker with TLS support. Additionally, it provides the capability to visualize the crafted FSM by installing all the required dependencies for the FSM visualizer.
